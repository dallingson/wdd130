        <p>Hello, My name is Dallin Georgeson. I am from Albuqerque, New Mexico. 
            I am the fifth of eight children in my family. I enjoy being outdoors and hanging out with friends.
            I also enjoy cooking and baking. I love to try new recipes that allow me to explore new foods. 
            One of my favorite things to make is cookies. I love a good chocolate chip cookie.
            I am currently a Computer Science Major at Brigham Young University Idaho,
            and I plan to get a masters degree in Human Factors Engineering after I finish my bachelors degree.
            I hope that my future career can help to improve life for the average person. There is so much we can do
            with modern technology that will make life easier.
            </p>

        <h2>New Mexico</h2>
        <img src="images/abq_NM.jpg" alt="Welcome to New Mexico">
        <p>New Mexico is known as the Land of Enchantment. It is one of the four corner states, and it is bordered by Arizona, Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas, and Mexico. New Mexico is famous for its Green and Red Chile as well as the International Balloon Fiesta. A fun fact about New Mexico is that it was originally proposed it be named be Lincoln. This was because it had failed to be granted statehood for so long that officials thought that the name Lincoln would gain favor in the sight of the Federal Government.</p>

        <p>New Mexico is known as the Land of Enchantment. It is one of the four corner states, and it is bordered by Arizona, Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas, and Mexico. New Mexico is famous for its Green and Red Chile as well as the International Balloon Fiesta. A fun fact about New Mexico is that it was originally proposed it be named be Lincoln. This was because it had failed to be granted statehood for so long that officials thought that the name Lincoln would gain favor in the sight of the Federal Government.</p>
